# Lending Club Case Study
> Lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss
(called credit loss). The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender 
when the borrower refusesto pay or runs away with the money owed.  

The main objective was to be able to identify these risky loan applicants, 
then such loans could be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. 
Identification of such applicants using EDA was the aim of this case study.   

Performed an analysis to understand the driving factors (or driver variables)
behind loan default, i.e.the variables which are strong indicators of default.  
The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
